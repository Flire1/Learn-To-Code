# Level 1 - Part 2: Variables

# 1. Basic Variable Assignment
name = "Bob"  # Assigning the text "Bob" to the variable 'name'
age = 25  # Assigning the number 25 to the variable 'age'

# 2. Using Variables with print()
print(f"Name: {name}") # Output: Name: Bob
print(f"Age: {age}") # Output: Age: 25
# Explanation: You can use variables inside the print() function to show their values.

# 3. Changing Variable Values
age = 26 # Changing the value of 'age'

# Explanation: This is another example of using variables with text.
